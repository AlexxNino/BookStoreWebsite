        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to The Booktown, where stories come to life! Our journey began 100 years ago with a simple passion: to bring the joy of reading to our community. From our humble beginnings as a small neighborhood shop, we've grown into a beloved destination for book lovers of all ages.</p>
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>The Booktown was founded in 1924 by Alex Nino, who believed in the magic of books and their power to transform lives. What started as a cozy corner shop has since evolved into a thriving hub for readers, writers, and thinkers. Over the years, we've expanded our shelves, welcomed countless authors for signings, and hosted events that celebrate the written word.</p>
        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p>At The Booktown, we believe in the timeless value of books and the stories they tell. Our core values guide everything we do:</p>

        <li>Inclusivity: Books are for everyone, and so is our store. We strive to create a welcoming space where all voices are heard and celebrated.</li>
        <li>Passion for Reading: We are driven by a deep love for literature. Our team of knowledgeable staff is here to help you discover new favorites and rediscover old classics.</li>
        <li>Sustainability: We care about our planet. That’s why we make thoughtful choices to minimize our environmental impact, from sourcing eco-friendly products to promoting the exchange of used books.</li>
        <li>Lifelong Learning: We believe in the power of books to educate, inspire, and empower. We offer a wide range of titles that cater to curious minds of all ages.</li>
